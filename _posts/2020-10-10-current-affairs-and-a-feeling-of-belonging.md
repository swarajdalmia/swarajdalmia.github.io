It's been 2 weeks since i have read any newspaper or article. Every once a while, due to one or the other extigency; personal, emotional or work related i decide to take some time away from this part of my civil life. Though a part of me gets time to just be by myself and concern myself with only my personal affairs, this period leaves me feeling alone with a loss of belonging and the loneliness that comes there after. 


This time, yet again, i'm reminded of how deeply intertwined ones personal is with whats happening outside, in the civil landscape. Not just the impact of the social and the political on ones personal life and those of ones peers, but also on ones sense of belonging. I wonder where that sense of belonging originates from ? Given this feeling, it is so difficult to juxtapose the fact that so many mental health issues around loneliness abound. Why are we as individuals feeling so alone, so often, despite the fact that we share so much in common with every other person ? Are we so tightly boughed down by our insecurities, fears and presumptions that we fail to tap into the human connection that exists all around us ?
